# かぜ (kaze)

A surrounding sensor that measures a bunch of things!
Heres a list of what it can measure:
 - Temperature (BME680)
 - Humidity (BME680)
 - Pressure (BME680)
 - CO<sub>2</sub> (SGP40)
 - lux (TSL2561)
 - and a couple more...

It is powered by the ESP32-C6 module and supports IoT protocols like Zigbee, Wi-fi, Bluetooth and Thread.
The software (that I will eventually write) will be for ESPHome as its very easy to set up IoT and home devices that way with the help of Home Assistant.
